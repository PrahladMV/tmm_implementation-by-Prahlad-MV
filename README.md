# **Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) for Multilayer Thin Films**

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the **Transfer Matrix Method (TMM)** for calculating the optical properties of multilayer thin films. The code can compute reflectance, transmittance, and absorption of thin-film stacks based on a variety of user inputs. It supports both single-wavelength and wavelength sweep modes.

## **Overview**

The **TMM for Optical Films** computes the optical properties (reflectance, transmittance, and absorption) of multilayer thin films using the Transfer Matrix Method. The code allows the user to calculate these properties at a single wavelength or over a range of wavelengths (wavelength sweep). It also allows the calculation of the electric field intensity profile for a given wavelength.

### **Key Features:**

* **Single-Wavelength Mode**: Computes and displays reflectance, transmittance, and absorption for a specific wavelength.
* **Wavelength Sweep Mode**: Computes and plots the optical properties across a range of wavelengths.
* **Electric Field Intensity Profile**: Option to compute and visualize the electric field intensity profile within the multilayer stack at a specific wavelength.

## **Usage Examples:**

### **1. Single-Wavelength Mode**

To compute the optical properties (reflectance, transmittance, and absorption) for a single wavelength:

```matlab
[R, T, A, r, t, M_global, theta] = tmm_optical_filmsv5(500, 0, 's', [1, 1.45, 2.0, 1], [100, 50]);
```

### **2. Wavelength Sweep Mode**

To compute and plot the spectra (transmittance and absorption) over a range of wavelengths:

```matlab
lambda = linspace(400, 800, 200);
[R, T, A] = tmm_optical_filmsv5(lambda, 0, 's', [1, 1.45, 2.0, 1], [100, 50]);
```

### **3. Interactive Mode**

If no input arguments are provided, the function prompts the user to input the necessary parameters and, after computing the spectra, asks if the electric field intensity profile should be computed.

```matlab
tmm_optical_filmsv5
```

## **Inputs:**

* **lambda**: Scalar (single wavelength in nm) or vector (wavelength sweep in nm).
* **theta0**: Incidence angle (in degrees).
* **pol**: Polarization ('s' for s-polarization or 'p' for p-polarization).
* **n**: Refractive indices vector `[n0, n1, ..., n_{M+1}]`, where `n0` is the incident medium and `n_{M+1}` is the substrate.
* **d**: Layer thicknesses vector (in nm) for the thin-film layers.

## **Outputs:**

For **single-wavelength mode**:

* **R**: Reflectance (|r|^2).
* **T**: Transmittance (with admittance ratio factor).
* **A**: Absorption (A = 1 - R - T).
* **r**: Complex reflection amplitude.
* **t**: Complex transmission amplitude.
* **M\_global**: Global transfer matrix for the multilayer structure.
* **theta**: Vector of propagation angles in each medium (in radians).

For **wavelength sweep mode**:

* **R**: Array of reflectance values at each wavelength.
* **T**: Array of transmittance values at each wavelength.
* **A**: Array of absorption values at each wavelength.

## **Functions:**

### `tmm_optical_filmsv5`

The main function that computes optical properties for multilayer thin films. It supports both single wavelength and wavelength sweep modes.

### `computeOpticalProps`

A helper function used by `tmm_optical_filmsv5` to compute the optical properties (reflectance, transmittance, and absorption) at a single wavelength.

### `computeElectricFieldProfile`

A function that calculates and plots the electric field intensity profile within the multilayer stack at a specified wavelength.

### `InterfaceMatrix`

This function computes the interface matrix between two media, which is used in the Transfer Matrix Method to propagate the field through the layers.

## **Interactive Electric Field Intensity Profile Calculation:**

After plotting the optical spectra, the function will prompt you if you would like to compute the **electric field intensity profile** at a single wavelength.

```matlab
Do you want to compute the electric field intensity profile? (y/n): 
```

If you choose 'y', you will be asked to input the wavelength at which you want to compute the electric field intensity profile.
